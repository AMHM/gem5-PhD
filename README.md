# gem5-PhD
This is the modified version of gem5 that was used during my PhD program. It is equiped with different stat tools regards to the challenges that should be considered when the memory technology of the cache is decided to change. It also delivers the requirements to run approximate computing applications in gem5 and support the corresponding program levels APIs (i.e. add_approx(..) and remove_approx(..)). For more information on this version of gem5 feel free to contact with me at amirmonazzah@gmail.com
